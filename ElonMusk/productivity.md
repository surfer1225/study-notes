1. Start your day with the most critical work
- For Musk, start the day at 7 a.m
- Half hour unblocking other people through email
- "Focus on signal over noise"
- Focus most important task that create the highest impact: apply 80-20 rule
2. Use feedback loop
- Think about what you have done and how you could have done it better
- Seek negative and truthful feedback
- Work on your personal and professional feedback
3. Reason from first principles
- Do not reason from analogy
- e.g. Rocket made of alumium, carbon fiber, copper etc, 2% of the cost of a rocket
- First principle gets down to the root of the problem
- Steps:
  1. Identify & define the current assumptions: When faced with a problem, write down the current assumptions
  1. Break it down into the fundamental principles: find the most basic truth about the problem. "Boil things down to the most fundamental truth, and say, ok, what we are sure is true and let's reason from there."
  1. Create the solutions: ready to create new solutions from scratch based on the truth for each smaller problem.
4. Use asynchronous communication
- Allow you to focus and dive deep on the more important work, with minimal interruptions from co-workers
- Decline meetings which do not have a clear agenda, use email to solve less important issues instead
5. Email tricks
- As few acronyms as possible
- As concise as possible
- Avoid "I feel", "Maybe" etc. to avoid ambiguity
- Have a goal about the email
- Bold the important part
- Forward email with clear action items you need from the intended recipients
6. Batch the tasks
- Batch tasks with similar mindsets, e.g. process emails, chats, set up calendars together
7. Scheduling
- 5-minute slots for Elon
- Prioritize manufacturing, engineering etc. Different people have different priorities
8. Embrace stretch goals
- Even not successful, it could be better than the more achievable ones
- "I say something, and then it usually happens. Maybe not on schedule, but it usually happens."
9. Develop a growth mindset
- You should take the approach that you're wrong. Your goal is to be less wrong.
- There is always room for improvement.
- Improvements can be compounded.
10. Develop a wide range of knowledge
- "T" or "Pi" shape knoweldge
- Learn from the best
